# Self-driving- Car 
 
# Aim  : 
* To automate the car to learn  and chang the steering angle according to the model developed . 
* To  apply the model and deploy and chek its model in the testing dataset. 

# Requirement 
* Tensor flow
* Scipy
* numpy 

# Data set 

*  Downlod the dataset from <a href ="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ue4XohCOV5YXy57S_5tDfCVqzLr101M7/view">here</a>

# How to run the code 
* First download the datset.
* Clone the repo . 
* Place the dataset in the cloned folder . 
* run the train.py file to  train the dataset  and develop the model. 
* run the run_dataset.py to predict the steering angle for the test data present
